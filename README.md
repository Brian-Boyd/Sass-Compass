# Tutorial on Sass, Compass and Grunt

This was a long and informative tutorial. It took me 4 days to complete and I can see how these tools can be very beneficial to a developer that codes CSS every day. However, unless you get everyday experience working with these tools, it might not be a great choice for a full stack developer who only works with CSS occassionally.
